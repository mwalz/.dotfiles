Mark Walz's .dotfiles
====================


Largely based on: 
Mathias Bynens (most everything)
https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

Paul Irish (OS X Settings)
https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles

Adjusted for my current OS X environment and development needs.

In the process (of possibly) migrating from MacPorts to Brew, so files are messy in places.

Run `setup.sh` to backup current files and copy files into place.

Thanks to Matt Lehman (https://github.com/mlehman) for the version switcher (see .functions file).
