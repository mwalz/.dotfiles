Mark Walz's .dotfiles
====================

Updated 2018-03-21

Largely based on:
Mathias Bynens (most everything)
https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

Paul Irish (OS X Settings)
https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles

Adjusted for current OS X environment and development needs.

Run `setup.sh` to backup current files and copy files into place.

Working on `backup-config.sh` for ongoing future backups.

Thanks to Matt Lehman (https://github.com/mlehman) for the version switcher (see .functions file).

That includes a useful ssh trick and some textutil info.
