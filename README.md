Mark Walz's .dotfiles
====================


Largely based on: 
Mathias Bynens (most everything)
https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

Paul Irish (OS X Settings)
https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles

Adjusted for current OS X environment and development needs.

Recently migrated to Brew for external libraries and installs.

Slate has been great. Key strokes on 3 computers standardized for window manipulation.

Run `setup.sh` to backup current files and copy files into place.

Working on `backup-config.sh` for ongoing future backups.

Thanks to Matt Lehman (https://github.com/mlehman) for the version switcher (see .functions file).
